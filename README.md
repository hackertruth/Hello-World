# Hello-World
The revolution is still being written
 
 Dear World,
 I know technology is taking over the very existence of life. As such some computer literate do take advantage of this at the expense of other.
 hackertruth is here to enforce cybersecurity and minimise cybercrimes. I pray thou strenghtens thee.
